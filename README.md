# Tech Flashcards
I became smooth-brained during the pandemic, so these flashcards are meant to help me remember terms, concepts, and code I learned in undergrad and during internships. There are 2 types of flashcard apps included - Quizlet and Mochi. Quizlet is good for reviewing terms and concepts while Mochi is good for reviewing code.
